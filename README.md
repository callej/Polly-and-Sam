# Polly and Sam
## What are the two numbers?

Polly and Sam are visited by a friend. The friend, having thought of two numbers between 2 and 800 inclusive, whispers their product to Polly and their sum to Sam. The following dialogue takes place:
<br>
Polly:     I don’t know the two numbers
<br>
Sam:      I know, and neither do I
<br>
Polly:     I know the two numbers
<br>
Sam:      So do I
<br>

What are the two numbers?

## Solution
There is a lot of “hidden” information in this problem. Or more accurately, it is a lot of information hidden in plain sight. 
Initially it may look impossible since it could be any two numbers between 2 and 800 inclusive, and neither of them have a clue what the numbers are. 
How could they then suddenly out of the blue know the two numbers?

When we look closer to this problem we will see that there are information we can use to start eliminating some combination of numbers 
until we finally will find that there is only one possible option. 
We will take this in steps from the information we have:

### Initial Condition
We are looking for 2 numbers, x and y, that can each be in the range [2,800]. In other words, we are looking for a pair 
(x,y), where x,y∈N ,    2≤x,y≤800
There are 799∙799=638401 possible combinations of (x,y)
